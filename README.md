## Projects 

#### [Brain Tumors Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/anushkarao5/BrainTumorDetectionCNN)
- Engineered a three-layered CNN to achieve a minimum recall of 86.5% in all tumor classes and an average tumor recall of 93.8%
- Implemented pre trained ResNet50 model to increase recall in the pituitary and meningioma tumor classes by 0.7% and 11%, respectively 
- Applied transfer learning to EfficientNetB0 model to achieve over 95% recall in all tumor classes and an average tumor recall of 95.7%

#### [Superconductor Regression Analysis](https://github.com/anushkarao5/SuperconductorRegressionAnalysis?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Developed a Random Forest model to predict the critical temperature of a superconductor with RMSE of 9.41 and R^2 value of 0.92
- Leveraged random forest and XGBoost feature importance scores to identify a subset of 13 of 81 features whose variance explained a minimum of 65% of the variance in critical temperatures for all non-tree based models

#### [US Airlines Twitter Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/anushkarao5/USAirlinesSentimentAnalysis?tab=readme-ov-file)

- Implemented logistic regression with count vectorization to achieve an overall accuracy of 77% in sentiment classification 
- Prioritized increased recall in minority sentiment classes (positive and neutral), resulting in an average minority class recall of 73%
- Developed a convolutional neural network using pre-trained GloVe word embeddings that resulted in an average minority class recall of 68.3%
